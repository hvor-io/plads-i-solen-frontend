En plads i solen (a spot in the sun) is an application mainly built with Python. It calculates shadows on the 
landsacpe on a given day in Copenhagen. This can be used to give an indication of where you can soak up the sun. 

In addition to Python the following tools are used:

* GRASS GIS
* A server with Linux installed (Digital Ocean in this instance)
* An installation of geoserver

## Usage

## BUGS
###
Had GRASS installed through OSGEO. Uninstalled it and installed it through the GRASS website.

###
Had to add C:\OSGeo4W\apps\grass\grass78\lib to the \$PATH\$ as it could not find the relevant dlls. 

### 
Had trouble with parsing the GRASSBIN env variable. Had to add '" "' to ensure interpreting as a string.
